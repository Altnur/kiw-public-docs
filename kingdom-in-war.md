# Kingdom in War

## Description

Kingdom in War is the goal of an ideal 2d rpg game.
Ranging from multiple features, from basic rpg elements, like leveling, classes, quests, etc, to more sophisticated mechanics, like building, sailing, and trading.

This game is my own personal idea of the ideal 2d rpg game, so I want to include everything I can.

## Stages

The game development will be splitted in phases or stages, in a way that will be released in small or big updates.
Starting from the very base and conceptual idea of an RPG, to the most complex systems.

### Planed stages
