# Mana gate

The mana gate is the event that caused the [arcane era](./arcane-era.md) to an end.

In the arcane era, [mana alteration](../concepts/mana-alteration.md) was not possible, but [mana machines](../concepts/mana-machines.md) were.

Mana machines were made, and making them work with a mana form called "electricity", without them knowning that, these machines were altering mana.

The arcane era was a prosperity era, where they grew exponentially thanks to these machines.

They tried to make better and better electricity generators, until, one day, they made something that made the mana from the core itself, to get attracted to that generator.

That make the core to be "opened" and freed all the mana inside itself, that is the origin of the name, "mana gate".
That mana, made all the mana machines to overcharge, and burn, or explode.

Some creatures (along with some humans) started to mutate, thanks to the massive quantities of mana that were distributed to them. Some of them even died.

That disaster, was also the birth of the mana stream, and endless stream of mana, that flows from the core, to the surface, and back again to the core.
