# Hammer

Taking a look to the hammer stats, it is noticeable that nothing stand out. But these two handed weapons have something special.

Hammers, if charged enough, can severely damage enemies armor, crushing them inside their protection. Thanks to that, they deal an extra quantity of damage with enemies that are better protected.
