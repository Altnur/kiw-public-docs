# Dagger

Daggers are fast, light weight, weapons, used to deal mortal blows.

Daggers are fast, and can be good weapons in direct combat, but their main advantage is that their charge attack is slower, but stronger than their edged companions.

In that way, they are perfect for a fast and quick attacks, trying to kill an opponent as fast as it can, but bad for long lasting combats.

Daggers are good weapons for thiefs, assassins, or secondary weapons for archers, as they are perfect to fast hits, and deal mortal blows.
