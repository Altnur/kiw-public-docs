# Flail

Fails are just a ball, attached to a stick, with a chain.

They are good range weapons, with almost the same, sometimes even larger, than spears. They also deal a good damage per hit. And even they can hit multiple enemies thanks to it range.

The downside is that they are hard weapons to master. The fast attack is throwin the ball to the front, and bringing it back, and the charged attack is swinging the ball arround.

The problem is that they are slow, and the part that hits is the ball, not the chain, so it can be hard to hit enemies with it.
