# Halberd

Halberds are the combination of the thrust of a spear, and the slash of an axe.

They are 2 hand weapons that are fearsome, thanks to it range, and damage.

The downside of this weapon is that they dont have a charged attack. Their charged attack is replaced by a thrust attack, and their fast atttack is a slash attack.
