# Mana

Some sort of essence, that is commonly called mana, is something that composes every form of this world.
Water is made from mana, trees, people, and animals, are made from mana, life, and earth, is made from mana.

This makes mana something essential for anything.

Mana composes these forms, and are strongly attached, so it's hard to split them.

Mana can't be destroyed, neither created, the mana only can be distributed to other forms.
When you drink water, the mana of the water is absorbed by your own body. When you burn a pile of wood, the mana of these logs are absorbed by the fire, making that fire stronger, because its own mana is bigger than before.

Before the [mana gate](../history/mana-gate.md), mana was very strongly attachd to the core of the world, so, that event, made possible the mana stream.

A stream that flows from the core of our world, to the surface, and back to the core.
With the mana stream, [mana alteration](./mana-alterator.md) is possible.
