# Mana machines

One of the inheritances of the arcane era, are mana machines.

Machines that are powered by mana. These machines can alter the mana with an incredible speed and performance. Sometimes even better than any mage.

This allows to make machines that alter the mana stream without the user having any knowledge about mana alteration.

There is also machines that allows mages to alter mana easier, like staffs, or enchanted clothes.

## Mana building requisites

- First, to build a mana machine, the builder has to understand perfectly the mana alteration that the machine is going to made.

- Second, they are costly. 3 rare materials are needed.
    - Condite: A mineral that can store large quantitys of mana.
    - Manductite: A mineral that can transfer mana from one form to another.
    - Malatite: That can expel and dispel the mana.

With these 3 materials, an infinite cycle can be made. First, mana is transfered from the condite, to the same condite,thanks to the manductite, thanks to that, and thanks to the form you make with the manductite, you can make the machine to alter the mana one way or another. The malatite is needed to expel and dispel the mana with every cycle, because the manductite would heat, and/or explode.

## Mana machines before the mana gate

Mana machines were used also in the arcane era, before the mana gate, but there was a reason for that.

They used a mana form, called "electricity", they created generators, made from big quantities of manductite, malatite and condite.

They believe that this mana form was the cause of the machines to work, but electricity was not the cause.

Electricity, like fire, is a very inconsistent form, so the mana that form them, can be transfered to other forms more easy than other forms. That makes electricity, a form that is a very good mana conductive.

These generators, were just mana attractors, that composed that mana into electricity, and then, send that mana to the machines.

Then, if they were mana machines like the current ones, why they exploded? The [core of the world](./mana.md) was "closed", and was strongly attracting all the mana, that forced the people from the arcane era, to build machines with stronger attraction force, to store the mana. When the mana gate happened, the mana machines attraction was so strong, that they overcharge with mana, making them explode.
