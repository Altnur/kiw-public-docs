# Mana alterator

Mana alterators, commonly named mages, are people with the minimum knowledge needed to alter the [stream of mana](./mana.md).

Mana alteration is just people, or creatures, using their own mana, to attract other mana, mainly from the mana stream, and altering it.

All creatures are made from mana, but there is a little deposit of mana, in every creature, that is called, mana pool, or MP.

That is, because, when a creature are born, they need that deposit to grow. Once they reach the adulthood, that deposit is useless.

Thanks to that deposit, or MP, we can use it to attract mana, and alter it, without danger.

Why it is dangerous? Because if you try to attract more mana that it is in your own MP, can affect to your health mana pool, or HP. That HP is what you are composed of, your life.

Depending on your MP, you can use stronger, or weaker spells, but using a stronger spell than you are capable of, can kill you.

For that reason, mages need to train that capacity, the mana condensation, and grow their MP.

## Mana levels

According to the [MMLS](../history/mana-manipulation-level-standard.md), there are 3 categories for magic power:
- Low
- Medium
- High

There is a fourth category, and is not recommended by the MRO, that is the Chaos category.

This category uses a technique called "Auto feedback magic stream", that creates a mini mana stream, capable of attract itself, and the mana around it.

This technique makes a big amount to mana to condense itself in an incontrolable way, that makes almost impossible for a mage to control it, without some sort of specialized mana machine or equipment.

So, if that quantity of mana, is cancelled suddenly, disasters can occur.

## Mana branches

Mana was developed in different ways and cultures, and are split in branchs

- Arcane magic
- Elemental magic
- Telekinetic magic
- Summon magic
- Nigromantic magic
- Sacred magic
- Dark magic
- Composed magic

While its not a branch, [mana machines](./mana-machines.md) are also another use of mana.
