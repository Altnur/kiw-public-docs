# Levels and Skills System

Player should be rewarded by their effort every time they play with their character.

There are many rewards, but in this document we talk about 2 of them:

- Level
- Skills

## Level

Level is basic, every time you level up a skill (described below) you gain experience, 1 xp for each skill, and when you reach certain experience, a level is gained.

The formula to the next level is:

Previous level experienice * 2.15

Taking account that to get to the level 2, 10 xp (Not clear yet) is needed.

## Skills

Skills are things that the player do, and get experience with that. Actions can give multiple skills at the same time.
For example:

If you use a sword, you gain 1 point of experience in 3 skills:

- Combat: Shared in any action related with combat
- Hand to hand: Shared with any hand to hand weapon
- Sword: Shared to all swords-type weapons.

Skills, like the general level of the player, can be leveled up gaining experience. Once you reach certain experience, a level is gained.

## Points

Each time you level up, you get a level point, and each time you level up a skill, you get a skill point.

Each point can be used by any stage in any way they want, but the "point" of this is that level point are used to unlock certain general things in your character, and skill points for unlock certain things for that specific skill.

## Dependences

This stage has no dependences.
